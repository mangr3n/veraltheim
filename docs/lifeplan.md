## 1. Metaphysical Considerations

### 1 Personal Identity

Personal identity, in the context of life planning, is understood as a dynamic pattern rather than a fixed entity:

1. **Pattern-Based Self**: 
   - Self as an evolving pattern implemented in matter, not reducible to matter itself.
   - Identity unfolds and manifests over time, fully appreciable only when viewed holistically.

2. **Continuity and Change**:
   - Allows for planning while acknowledging significant evolution of self over time.
   - Emphasizes guiding the pattern's evolution rather than setting goals for a static entity.

3. **Implications for Life Planning**:
   - Necessitates flexible planning to accommodate growth and transformation.
   - Goals should address both external achievements and desired character evolution.
   - Considers ethical responsibilities in shaping one's pattern and its influence on surrounding systems.

4. **Conceptual Connections**:
   - Aligns with narrative identity theory: self constructed through life stories.
   - Resonates with views of consciousness as an emergent property of complex systems.

5. **Key Questions**:
   - How does this view of identity impact free will and decision-making?
   - What methods can we use to observe and measure the evolution of personal patterns?
   - How does memory contribute to maintaining pattern continuity?

### 2. **Free Will and Self-Motivation**

Free will, in the context of life planning, is not just about the ability to make choices, but about understanding and harnessing our capacity for self-directed action.

1. **Compatibilist View of Free Will**:
   - Acknowledges both deterministic factors and personal agency.
   - Emphasizes our ability to act according to our own motivations and reasons.

2. **Free Will as a Practical Capacity**:
   - Focus on developing the skills and mindset to make deliberate choices.
   - Recognizes external influences while emphasizing our power to shape responses.

3. **Self-Motivation Through Free Will**:
   - Understanding free will as a tool for cultivating intrinsic motivation.
   - Using awareness of choice to align actions with personal values and goals.

4. **Strategies for Leveraging Free Will in Self-Motivation**:
   - Mindfulness practices to increase awareness of decision-making processes.
   - Regular reflection on personal values to guide choices.
   - Developing a growth mindset to view challenges as opportunities for exercising will.

5. **Overcoming Psychological Barriers**:
   - Addressing limiting beliefs that undermine sense of agency.
   - Techniques for managing decision fatigue and analysis paralysis.

6. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Balancing personal agency with responsibility to others and society.
   - Cultivating a sense of "we-will" - collective intentionality in shared goals.

7. **Practical Applications in Life Planning**:
   - Setting goals that leverage intrinsic motivation.
   - Creating systems that support intentional decision-making.
   - Regular reassessment of choices to ensure alignment with evolving values.

By deepening our understanding of free will and its role in self-motivation, we can create more effective and personally resonant life plans. This approach empowers us to take ownership of our choices and actions, leading to greater fulfillment and purpose in our pursuits.

### 3. **Causality**: The idea that our actions now will have predictable effects on our future state.



### 4. **Time**: The conception of time as linear and progressive, allowing for future planning.

### 5. **Value and Meaning**: The assumption that life can have purpose and that certain states or achievements are more desirable than others.

### 6. **Knowability of the Future**: The belief that we can, to some extent, anticipate future conditions and prepare for them.

### 7. **Mind-Body Relationship**: How our mental states (goals, desires) relate to physical reality and actions.
