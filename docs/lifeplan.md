## 1. Metaphysical Considerations

### 1 Personal Identity

Personal identity, in the context of life planning, is understood as a dynamic pattern rather than a fixed entity:

1. **Pattern-Based Self**: 
   - Self as an evolving pattern implemented in matter, not reducible to matter itself.
   - Identity unfolds and manifests over time, fully appreciable only when viewed holistically.

1. **Continuity and Change**:
   - Allows for planning while acknowledging significant evolution of self over time.
   - Emphasizes guiding the pattern's evolution rather than setting goals for a static entity.

1. **Implications for Life Planning**:
   - Necessitates flexible planning to accommodate growth and transformation.
   - Prioritizes character evolution over external achievements, while recognizing the necessity of maintaining the physical substrate.
   - Balances abstract pattern evolution with concrete needs of physical existence.
   - Considers ethical responsibilities in shaping one's pattern and its influence on surrounding systems.

1. Material Reality and Abstract Patterns:
   - Acknowledges the inescapable need to maintain physical well-being as the substrate for pattern implementation.
   - Recognizes the interdependence between abstract personal evolution and concrete survival needs.

1. **Conceptual Connections**:
   - Aligns with narrative identity theory: self constructed through life stories.
   - Resonates with views of consciousness as an emergent property of complex systems.
   

1. **Key Questions**:
   - How can we balance focus on character evolution with necessary attention to physical needs?
   - What methods can we use to observe and measure the evolution of personal patterns?
   - How does the physical substrate influence or constrain the potential evolution of the self-pattern?

### 2. **Free Will**
The belief that we have the ability to make choices that influence our future.

### 3. **Causality**
The idea that our actions now will have predictable effects on our future state.

### 4. **Time**
The conception of time as linear and progressive, allowing for future planning.

### 5. **Value and Meaning**
The assumption that life can have purpose and that certain states or achievements are more desirable than others.

### 6. **Knowability of the Future**
The belief that we can, to some extent, anticipate future conditions and prepare for them.

### 7. **Mind-Body Relationship**
How our mental states (goals, desires) relate to physical reality and actions.

## 2. David Boyer: A Dynamic Pattern

[Note: This section has been consolidated and compacted based on accumulated insights]

### 1 Core Attributes

- Philosophical Thinker: Deeply engaged with metaphysical concepts, especially relating to personal identity and self.
- Pattern-Oriented: Conceptualizes self and world in terms of dynamic, evolving patterns.
- Meta-Cognitive: Interested in processes of thinking, learning, and collaboration.
- Value-Driven: Focuses on aligning behavior with core values rather than external perceptions.

### 2 Approach to Personal Development

- Profilicity: Values independent external perspectives to uncover blind spots and challenge self-perception.
- Foundational Focus: Prioritizes establishing solid metaphysical and theoretical groundwork before practical applications.
- Systemic Thinking: Views personal growth as interrelated patterns rather than isolated traits or actions.

### 3 Intellectual Traits

- Conceptual Innovation: Creates new terms (e.g., "profilicity") to encapsulate complex ideas.
- Methodical Progression: Prefers systematic exploration of ideas, building complexity on established foundations.

### 4 Collaboration Style

- Intellectual Independence: Values collaborators who maintain independent perspectives and offer constructive challenges.
- Process-Aware: Interested in the mechanics of collaboration and information processing.

### 5 Information Management

- Synthesis-Oriented: Prefers consolidated, compact insights over expansive collections of observations.
- Efficiency in Knowledge: Values distilled, refined understanding that evolves over time.

## 3. Life Plan Structure (Initial Draft)

1. **Vision and Values**
   - Long-term aspirations
   - Core personal values

2. **Life Domains**
   - Career/Professional
   - Personal/Relationships
   - Health and Wellness
   - Financial
   - Personal Growth/Education
   - Spiritual/Philosophical
   - Community/Social Contribution

3. **Goal Setting**
   - Short-term goals (1 year)
   - Medium-term goals (1-5 years)
   - Long-term goals (5+ years)

4. **Action Plans**
   - Specific steps for each goal
   - Resources needed
   - Potential obstacles and solutions

5. **Tracking and Review System**
   - Regular check-ins (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually)
   - Metrics for success
   - Reflection and adjustment process

6. **Flexibility and Adaptation**
   - Strategies for handling unexpected changes
   - Process for updating the plan

## 4. Next Steps

1. Expand on each section of the Life Plan Structure
2. Develop a system for regular review and updates
3. Create associated tools (e.g., tracking spreadsheet, reflection journal)
4. Explore deeper philosophical implications of each life domain
