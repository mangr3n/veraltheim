## 1. Metaphysical Considerations

### 1 Personal Identity

Personal identity, in the context of life planning, is understood as a dynamic pattern rather than a fixed entity:

1. **Pattern-Based Self**: 
   - Self as an evolving pattern implemented in matter, not reducible to matter itself.
   - Identity unfolds and manifests over time, fully appreciable only when viewed holistically.

1. **Continuity and Change**:
   - Allows for planning while acknowledging significant evolution of self over time.
   - Emphasizes guiding the pattern's evolution rather than setting goals for a static entity.

1. **Implications for Life Planning**:
   - Necessitates flexible planning to accommodate growth and transformation.
   - Prioritizes character evolution over external achievements, while recognizing the necessity of maintaining the physical substrate.
   - Balances abstract pattern evolution with concrete needs of physical existence.
   - Considers ethical responsibilities in shaping one's pattern and its influence on surrounding systems.

1. Material Reality and Abstract Patterns:
   - Acknowledges the inescapable need to maintain physical well-being as the substrate for pattern implementation.
   - Recognizes the interdependence between abstract personal evolution and concrete survival needs.

1. **Conceptual Connections**:
   - Aligns with narrative identity theory: self constructed through life stories.
   - Resonates with views of consciousness as an emergent property of complex systems.

1. **Key Questions and Meta-Principles**:
   1. **Balancing Abstract and Concrete Aspects of Self**:
      - Meta-Principle: Recognize the bidirectional influence between character evolution and physical well-being.
      - Question: How can we create a framework for decision-making that weighs both character development and physical necessities?

   1. **Measuring Pattern Evolution**:
      - Meta-Principle: Acknowledge that self-pattern evolution occurs across multiple dimensions (cognitive, emotional, behavioral, etc.).
      - Question: What metrics or reflection methods can we develop to track multidimensional pattern changes over time?

   1. **Physical-Abstract Interaction**:
      - Meta-Principle: The physical substrate both enables and constrains pattern evolution.
      - Question: How do different physical states (health, environment, etc.) correspond to different potentials for pattern evolution?
### 2. **Free Will**
The belief that we have the ability to make choices that influence our future.

### 3. **Causality**
The idea that our actions now will have predictable effects on our future state.

### 4. **Time**
The conception of time as linear and progressive, allowing for future planning.

### 5. **Value and Meaning**
The assumption that life can have purpose and that certain states or achievements are more desirable than others.

### 6. **Knowability of the Future**
The belief that we can, to some extent, anticipate future conditions and prepare for them.

### 7. **Mind-Body Relationship**
How our mental states (goals, desires) relate to physical reality and actions.

[Note: This section has been consolidated and compacted based on accumulated insights]

## 2. David Boyer: A Dynamic Pattern

### 1 Core Attributes
- Philosophical Thinker: Deeply engaged with metaphysical concepts, especially relating to personal identity and self.
- Pattern-Oriented: Conceptualizes self and world in terms of dynamic, evolving patterns.
- Meta-Cognitive: Interested in processes of thinking, learning, and collaboration.
- Value-Driven: Focuses on aligning behavior with core values rather than external perceptions.
- Pragmatic Idealist: Balances abstract philosophical concepts with practical, real-world considerations.

### 2 Approach to Personal Development
- Profilicity: Values independent external perspectives to uncover blind spots and challenge self-perception.
- Foundational Focus: Prioritizes establishing solid metaphysical and theoretical groundwork before practical applications.
- Systemic Thinking: Views personal growth as interrelated patterns rather than isolated traits or actions.
- Holistic Integration: Seeks to harmonize abstract pattern evolution with concrete physical needs.

### 3 Intellectual Traits

- Conceptual Innovation: Creates new terms (e.g., "profilicity") to encapsulate complex ideas.
- Methodical Progression: Prefers systematic exploration of ideas, building complexity on established foundations.
- Critical Evaluation: Consistently questions and refines conceptual frameworks and methodologies.
- Preference for Universal Principles: Favors developing broadly applicable meta-principles over situation-specific guidelines.

### 4 Collaboration Style

- Intellectual Independence: Values collaborators who maintain independent perspectives and offer constructive challenges.
- Process-Aware: Interested in the mechanics of collaboration and information processing.
- Consistency Expectation: Anticipates ongoing evolution and application of established processes and understandings.

### 5 Information Management

- Synthesis-Oriented: Prefers consolidated, compact insights over expansive collections of observations.
- Efficiency in Knowledge: Values distilled, refined understanding that evolves over time.
- Continuous Refinement: Expects ongoing updates and revisions to conceptual models based on new interactions and insights.
