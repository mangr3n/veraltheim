# Life Plan Framework

## 1. Metaphysical Considerations

### 1.1 Personal Identity

The concept of personal identity is central to the idea of life planning. Our initial framework suggested a "continuous 'self' that persists through time," but this requires deeper examination.

#### 1.1.1 Self as a Dynamic Pattern

- **Pattern, Not Static Matter**: The self is better understood as a dynamic pattern rather than a fixed material entity. This pattern is implemented in matter but is not reducible to it.

- **Unfolding Over Time**: The pattern that constitutes "self" (in this case, the pattern of "David Boyer") plays out and manifests over time. It's not a static entity but a continually evolving process.

- **Holistic Perspective**: The true nature of this pattern can only be fully appreciated when viewed in its totality, across the entire span of one's existence.

#### 1.1.2 Implications for Life Planning

1. **Continuity and Change**: While there's a continuity that allows for planning, we must account for the fact that the "self" at the end of the plan may be significantly different from the current self.

2. **Pattern Steering**: Life planning becomes an exercise in guiding the evolution of one's pattern, rather than setting goals for a static entity.

3. **Narrative Identity**: This view aligns with the concept of narrative identity, where the self is constructed through the stories we tell about our lives.

4. **Flexibility in Planning**: Recognizing the self as a dynamic pattern necessitates building flexibility into life plans, allowing for growth and transformation.

5. **Multidimensional Goals**: Goals in a life plan should address not just external achievements, but also the desired evolution of one's pattern or character.

6. **Ethical Considerations**: If we are patterns unfolding, what responsibility do we have in shaping that pattern? How does this impact our choices and their long-term consequences?

7. **Interconnectedness**: As patterns implemented in matter, how do we interact with and influence other patterns (people, systems) around us?

#### 1.1.3 Questions for Further Exploration

- How does the concept of self as a pattern impact our understanding of free will and decision-making?
- In what ways can we "observe" or measure the evolution of our personal pattern over time?
- How does this view of identity influence our relationships and social interactions?
- What role does memory play in maintaining the continuity of this pattern?

2. **Free Will**: The belief that we have the ability to make choices that influence our future.

3. **Causality**: The idea that our actions now will have predictable effects on our future state.

4. **Time**: The conception of time as linear and progressive, allowing for future planning.

5. **Value and Meaning**: The assumption that life can have purpose and that certain states or achievements are more desirable than others.

6. **Knowability of the Future**: The belief that we can, to some extent, anticipate future conditions and prepare for them.

7. **Mind-Body Relationship**: How our mental states (goals, desires) relate to physical reality and actions.

## 2. Life Plan Structure (Initial Draft)

1. **Vision and Values**
   - Long-term aspirations
   - Core personal values

2. **Life Domains**
   - Career/Professional
   - Personal/Relationships
   - Health and Wellness
   - Financial
   - Personal Growth/Education
   - Spiritual/Philosophical
   - Community/Social Contribution

3. **Goal Setting**
   - Short-term goals (1 year)
   - Medium-term goals (1-5 years)
   - Long-term goals (5+ years)

4. **Action Plans**
   - Specific steps for each goal
   - Resources needed
   - Potential obstacles and solutions

5. **Tracking and Review System**
   - Regular check-ins (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually)
   - Metrics for success
   - Reflection and adjustment process

6. **Flexibility and Adaptation**
   - Strategies for handling unexpected changes
   - Process for updating the plan

## 3. Next Steps

1. Expand on each section of the Life Plan Structure
2. Develop a system for regular review and updates
3. Create associated tools (e.g., tracking spreadsheet, reflection journal)
4. Explore deeper philosophical implications of each life domain
