# Life Plan Framework

## 1. Metaphysical Considerations

### 1.1 Personal Identity

The concept of personal identity is central to the idea of life planning. Our initial framework suggested a "continuous 'self' that persists through time," but this requires deeper examination.

#### 1.1.1 Self as a Dynamic Pattern

- **Pattern, Not Static Matter**: The self is better understood as a dynamic pattern rather than a fixed material entity. This pattern is implemented in matter but is not reducible to it.

- **Unfolding Over Time**: The pattern that constitutes "self" (in this case, the pattern of "David Boyer") plays out and manifests over time. It's not a static entity but a continually evolving process.

- **Holistic Perspective**: The true nature of this pattern can only be fully appreciated when viewed in its totality, across the entire span of one's existence.

#### 1.1.2 Implications for Life Planning

1. **Continuity and Change**: While there's a continuity that allows for planning, we must account for the fact that the "self" at the end of the plan may be significantly different from the current self.

2. **Pattern Steering**: Life planning becomes an exercise in guiding the evolution of one's pattern, rather than setting goals for a static entity.

3. **Narrative Identity**: This view aligns with the concept of narrative identity, where the self is constructed through the stories we tell about our lives.

4. **Flexibility in Planning**: Recognizing the self as a dynamic pattern necessitates building flexibility into life plans, allowing for growth and transformation.

5. **Multidimensional Goals**: Goals in a life plan should address not just external achievements, but also the desired evolution of one's pattern or character.

6. **Ethical Considerations**: If we are patterns unfolding, what responsibility do we have in shaping that pattern? How does this impact our choices and their long-term consequences?

7. **Interconnectedness**: As patterns implemented in matter, how do we interact with and influence other patterns (people, systems) around us?

#### 1.1.3 Questions for Further Exploration

- How does the concept of self as a pattern impact our understanding of free will and decision-making?
- In what ways can we "observe" or measure the evolution of our personal pattern over time?
- How does this view of identity influence our relationships and social interactions?
- What role does memory play in maintaining the continuity of this pattern?

2. **Free Will**: The belief that we have the ability to make choices that influence our future.

3. **Causality**: The idea that our actions now will have predictable effects on our future state.

4. **Time**: The conception of time as linear and progressive, allowing for future planning.

5. **Value and Meaning**: The assumption that life can have purpose and that certain states or achievements are more desirable than others.

6. **Knowability of the Future**: The belief that we can, to some extent, anticipate future conditions and prepare for them.

7. **Mind-Body Relationship**: How our mental states (goals, desires) relate to physical reality and actions.

## 2. David Boyer: A Dynamic Pattern

- Adaptive Strategies: Developing approaches that allow for flexibility and evolution in the life plan.
- Mind-Body Connection: Exploring how physical habits and practices influence the overall life pattern.

### 2.6 Meta-Cognitive Traits

- Process-Oriented: David shows interest not just in the content of discussions, but in the process of how information is gathered and updated. This suggests a meta-cognitive approach to thinking and learning.
- Verification-Seeking: By asking about the updating process, David demonstrates a desire to verify and understand the mechanisms behind collaborative work.
- Attention to Detail: The question about continuous updating reveals an eye for detail and a concern for consistency and follow-through.

### 2.7 Collaborative Style
