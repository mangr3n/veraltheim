# Note Processing Instructions

## Document Structure
1. Synopsis (overall narrative arc)
2. Prelude - Conjecture (fundamental assertions)
3. Opening: Problem Statement
4. Thesis
5. Exposition
6. Apologia
7. Declaration/Proclamation
8. Conclusion

## Processing Steps for Each Note
1. Add note's contribution to Problem Statement section
2. Add note's contribution to Thesis section
3. Add note's contribution to Exposition section
4. Add note's contribution to Apologia section
5. Add note's contribution to Declaration section
6. Synthesize a single concluding statement for the note
7. Derive a conjecture that captures the note's fundamental assertion
8. Update the synopsis to include the note's contribution to the narrative arc

## Guidelines for Each Section

### Problem Statement
- What issue or challenge does the note identify?
- What problems arise from current misunderstandings?
- What gaps or failures does the note highlight?

### Thesis
- What fundamental claim or insight does the note present?
- What core understanding does it offer?
- How does it reframe or deepen previous understanding?

### Exposition
- How does this manifest or work in practice?
- What examples or patterns demonstrate this?
- How does it play out in different contexts?

### Apologia
- Why is this understanding important?
- What goes wrong when we don't understand this?
- What makes this insight crucial for progress?

### Declaration
- What actions or approaches should we take?
- How should we apply this understanding?
- What principles should guide implementation?

### Conclusion
- Single statement synthesizing the note's complete arc
- Shows progression from problem through understanding to approach
- Captures the note's unique contribution to the larger narrative

### Conjecture
- Fundamental assertion underlying the note's perspective
- Core claim that drives the note's insights
- How it builds on or extends previous conjectures

### Synopsis
- How does this note advance the overall narrative?
- What new dimension does it add to our understanding?
- How does it connect to and build upon previous notes?

## Order of Operations
1. Process sections 1-5 first (Problem through Declaration)
2. Then derive the Conjecture
3. Then write the Conclusion
4. Finally update the Synopsis

## Key Principles
- Each section builds on previous sections
- Maintain coherence within each note
- Show how each note connects to the larger narrative
- Keep entries clear and concise
- Ensure logical progression of ideas

## Quality Checks
- Does each section clearly contribute to the note's overall argument?
- Are connections between sections logical and clear?
- Does the conclusion effectively synthesize the note's key insights?
- Does the conjecture capture the fundamental assertion?
- Does the synopsis update show how this note advances the larger narrative?
