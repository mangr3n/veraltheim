## Current Task: Initial Content Mining
We are working to extract and develop the raw material that will form the basis of "The Book of Life". This involves:

1. **Document Review Process**
   - Systematically review genesis documents:
     - [actual_conversation.md](genesis/actual_conversation.md) (raw initial conversation)
     - [founding_conversation.md](genesis/founding_conversation.md) (structured version)
   - Capture raw notes and insights in [notes/raw_notes.md](notes/raw_notes.md)
   - Format for each note entry:
     - Source document
     - Context/Quote (if relevant)
     - Raw thoughts/insights
     - Initial thoughts on section relevance

2. **Content Organization**
   The content will ultimately be organized into five major sections as detailed in [mission.md](mission.md):
   - Problem Statement (Opening)
   - Thesis
   - Exposition
   - Apologia
   - Declaration/Proclamation

3. **Workflow**
   - Review genesis documents
   - Collect raw notes and insights
   - Later categorize notes by their relevance to each section
   - Use categorized notes to develop structured content
   - Refine into final document sections

## Purpose
This process allows us to:
- Preserve all valuable insights from the founding conversations
- Maintain flexibility in how content can be used
- Build a comprehensive foundation for the final work
- Ensure no critical ideas are lost in the development process

## Next Steps
1. Choose starting document (actual_conversation.md or founding_conversation.md)
2. Begin systematic review and note-taking
3. Collect raw insights without immediate categorization
4. Later organize notes into relevant sections
5. Develop structured content from organized notes

## Reboot Instructions
To restart this conversation:
1. Reference this Tasks.md file
2. Confirm directory structure is intact
3. Review mission.md for overall project scope
4. Continue with document review and note-taking process
5. Use raw_notes.md as the working document for collecting insights

The goal is to maintain continuity while allowing for flexible, iterative development of the content.
