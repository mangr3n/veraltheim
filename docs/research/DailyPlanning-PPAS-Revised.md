Please fill out the following form, providing detailed responses to each section:

**1\. Topic/Problem Description**  
\[Provide a clear, concise description of your topic or problem. Include key aspects, background information, and any specific areas you want to focus on.\]

| I am seeking a structured process to help manage the content of my day, including projects and routines. This system should assist in planning my next steps proactively, adjusting dynamically as the day unfolds, and enabling efficient tracking and updating of tasks. The focus is on building a reliable, flexible framework to support both short-term actions and long-term project management. |
| :---- |

**2\. Goals and Objectives**  
\[List your main goals and objectives for this exploration. What do you hope to achieve or understand better? Be as specific as possible.\]

| I aim to create a structured, human-readable GitHub repository that organizes relevant artifacts with clear information pathways and decision-making documentation. The goal is to establish a repeatable process for updating and maintaining this repository. This process should integrate AI to automate content management, utilizing predefined prompts and attachments to ensure the system remains adaptive and scalable. |

**3\.** **Prior Knowledge and Experience**  
\[Describe your current level of knowledge or experience related to this topic. Include any relevant background, education, or previous research you've done.\]

| With 25 years of programming experience, I am well-versed in self-directed learning and have a high aptitude for rapid skill acquisition and integration. I intend to leverage my deep technical expertise and capacity for learning to maximize the impact of this project. |

**4\. Preferences and Additional Details**  
\[Specify any preferences for the type of information you're seeking (e.g., academic, practical, cutting-edge). Mention any specific sources, methodologies, or approaches you're interested in. Include any other details that would help tailor the AI's responses to your needs.\]

| The focus should be on practical, actionable information. While cutting-edge AI research and prompting methods are important, they should be limited to what can be implemented through accessible, low-cost resources. I envision a project that starts with manual processes (e.g., command line tools and text editors like an IDE) and evolves into a locally hosted web application. The end goal is to develop a dashboard for task and status tracking, which eventually grows into a standalone application that users can run on their own computers.  |

**5\. Scope and Limitations**  
\[Define the boundaries of your exploration. What aspects are you specifically including or excluding? Are there any time periods, geographical areas, or subtopics you want to focus on or avoid?\]

| Not sure what to include here.  I want the technologies and dataformats that I use to be current and standard, but also human readable and accessible, so that migrating from manual interaction to automated tracking and update can be a smooth transition over time.  |
| :---- |

**6\. Desired Depth and Complexity**  
\[Indicate the level of depth you're looking for in the AI's responses. Do you need a high-level overview or an in-depth analysis? Specify if you require technical details or simplified explanations.\]

| I require a high-level project roadmap combined with a detailed, robust starting process. The initial focus is on implementing a manual workflow that I can use to bootstrap the project, which will serve as the foundation for future developments. |
| :---- |

**7\. Output Format Preferences**  
\[Describe how you'd like the information presented. For example: bullet points, short paragraphs, detailed explanations, or a combination.\]

| I expect the output to be a clear, structured document that articulates the process and structure of the GitHub repository, including artifacts and the procedures for updating and managing them. The document should be accessible to both human readers and AI systems to ensure seamless comprehension and execution.  |
| :---- |

**8\. Additional Questions or Areas of Interest**  
\[List any specific questions or subtopics within your main topic that you'd like the AI to address.\]
