# Veraltheim Project Tasks

## 🌟 Project Vision
Veraltheim serves as the true mountain home, while Geistforge acts as its pattern-weaving companion. In ancient wisdom, spirit (Geist) was understood as fundamental pattern - the metapatterns that shape and guide reality. Geistforge thus represents both:
- A forge for discovering and shaping patterns
- A companion that helps navigate pattern-space
- A bridge between abstract patterns and their implementations
